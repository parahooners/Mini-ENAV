Ever wandered off the beaten path and wished you had a super simple way to point back home? Whether you're hiking a mountain trail 🌲, paddling across a lake 🛶, backpacking through the wilderness 🎒, walking the dog in a new park 🐕, or even flying your paramotor 🪂, the Mini ENAV has got your back!

## What's the Big Idea? 🤔

This project turns a nifty little LilyGO E-Paper Watch into a minimalist navigation device. Forget complex maps! Mini ENAV focuses on one core mission: **getting you back to where you started.**

## How it Works ✨

1.  **Find Your Spot:** Get to your starting point (your car, campsite, launch spot, etc.).
2.  **Set Home:** Press and hold the button until the device vibrates. Boom! Home point saved. 🏡
3.  **Adventure Time!** Go explore! Hike, fly, walk, paddle - do your thing!
4.  **"Uh Oh, Which Way?"** Glance at your Mini ENAV.
    *   The **big number** in the center shows your distance from home (in meters if you're close, kilometers if you're further out).
    *   The **dot** around the edge points directly towards your saved home point, just like a compass pointing North, but this points *Home*! 🧭➡️🏡
    *   You also get handy info like current speed (below distance), altitude (top right), battery level (bottom left), and GPS satellite count (bottom right).
5.  **Follow the Dot:** Walk (or fly, or paddle!) in the direction the dot is pointing. As you get closer, the distance number will drop.

It's navigation boiled down to the basics: **distance and direction**. Perfect for when you just need a straight line back to safety or your starting point.

Happy Adventuring! 🎉
