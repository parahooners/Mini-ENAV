## What's the Big Idea? ü§î

This project turns a nifty little LilyGO E-Paper Watch into a minimalist navigation device. Forget complex maps! Mini ENAV focuses on one core mission: **getting you back to where you started.**

---

## Features

- **Navigation Indicators**:
  - Displays distance and heading to a home point or takeoff point.
  - Updates dynamically based on GPS data.
  - Support for up to 5 custom Points of Interest (POIs) that can be saved and tracked.
- **Bluetooth LE Connectivity**:
  - Connect with a web interface through your phone's browser to manage waypoints.
  - Save, activate, and deactivate custom locations remotely.
  - View all saved locations when connecting to the device.
- **Fuel Tracking**:
  - Tracks remaining fuel in liters.
  - Displays estimated flight time based on fuel burn rate.
- **Flight Hours Tracking**:
  - Accumulates total flight hours and stores them persistently in EEPROM.
  - Displays total flight hours on the "Wait GPS" screen.
- **Settings Screen**:
  - Allows adjustment of:
    - **Fuel quantity**: Set the current fuel level in liters.
    - **Fuel burn rate**: Adjust the fuel consumption rate in liters per hour.
    - **Fuel display visibility**: Toggle the visibility of the fuel display.
  - Displays **estimated flight time** based on the current fuel and burn rate.
- **Energy Efficiency**:
  - CPU frequency reduced to **40 MHz** to maximize power efficiency.
  - E-paper display refresh rate optimized to 0.8 seconds.
  - Deep sleep mode implemented for inactivity.
- **Haptic Feedback**:
  - Vibration motor for tactile feedback during key actions.

## Hardware

- LilyGO E-Paper Watch (ESP32)
- 1.54" GxEPD e-paper display
- GPS module (connected to RX/TX)
- Vibration motor
- Battery (LiPo)
- Button for setting home point

## 3D-Printed Case

A 3D-printable case is available for this project.  
**[Download STL files here (GitHub)](https://github.com/parahooners/Mini-ENAV/tree/main/include/STL%20files%20for%20case)**

> **Note:** To fit the watch into the provided 3D case, you will need to use a **half-size GPS antenna**. The standard antenna that comes with the watch is too large.

---

## Build & Setup (VSCode + PlatformIO)

1. **Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**
2. **Install [PlatformIO extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)**
3. **Clone this repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/parahooners/Mini-ENAV.git
   ```
4. **Open the project folder in VSCode**
5. **Connect your ESP32 device via USB**
6. **Select the correct serial port in PlatformIO (bottom bar)**
7. **Build and upload the firmware**
   - Click the "PlatformIO: Upload" button (checkmark/arrow icon)
   - Or run:
     ```
     pio run --target upload
     ```
8. **Monitor serial output (optional)**
   - Click "PlatformIO: Monitor" or run:
     ```
     pio device monitor
     ```

## How to Operate the Mini ENAV

1. **Power On:**  
   Device starts and waits for GPS fix ("Wait GPS" message).
2. **Set Home Point:**  
   Short press the button to set your current location as "Home". The device validates GPS accuracy to ensure reliable home points.
3. **Takeoff Point Detection:**  
   After moving >500m from Home, the device automatically marks your takeoff location with a "T" indicator.
4. **Display Overview:**
   - **Center:** Distance to Home (in meters if you're close, kilometers if you're further out). Speed shown below.
   - **Top Right:** Altitude (feet)
   - **Bottom Left:** Battery percentage
   - **Bottom Right:** Number of satellites
   - **Ring Indicators:**  
     - "H" = Home direction  
     - "T" = Takeoff point direction
     - "1-5" = Custom waypoint directions (when set via BLE)
5. **Long Press (5 seconds):**  
   Long-press the button for 5 seconds to enter sleep mode.
6. **Sleep Mode:**  
   Device also enters sleep after 10 minutes of inactivity. Press the button to wake.
7. **Charging:**  
   Charge via USB as per your ESP32 board's instructions.

## Settings Page

The settings page is accessible only within the first 10 seconds after the unit starts up by pressing the button. On the settings page, you can:

- Adjust the starting fuel litres (increments by 0.5).
- Adjust the fuel burn rate (increments by 0.1).
- Toggle the visibility of the Jerry Can and fuel litres display on the main navigation and GPS wait screens.

To change a value, press the button while the selection box is on the desired setting. After 5 seconds of inactivity, the selection box moves to the next setting. When all settings are configured, the values are saved to EEPROM and the unit restarts.

## Web Interface (Bluetooth LE)

The Mini ENAV now includes Bluetooth LE connectivity with a web interface for managing waypoints:

1. **Accessing the Web Interface:**
   - Use a Web Bluetooth compatible browser (Chrome, Edge, or Opera on Android/Windows/Mac)
   - Open the `web/index.html` file locally or host it on a website
   - Click "Connect to Mini ENAV" to establish a connection

2. **Managing Waypoints:**
   - **View Saved Locations:** When connected, all saved waypoints are displayed automatically
   - **Add/Update Waypoint:**
     - Select a location number (1-5)
     - Set status (ON/OFF)
     - Enter coordinates manually or click on the map
     - Click "Send Location"
   - **Modify Waypoint:** Click "Load" on an existing waypoint to edit it

3. **Navigation Interface:**
   - The map displays all active waypoints
   - Each waypoint appears as a numbered marker
   - The device shows directions to active waypoints on the display

4. **Notes:**
   - The web interface works best on mobile phones for on-the-go waypoint management
   - Waypoints persist through device reboots and power cycles
   - A maximum of 5 custom waypoints can be stored
